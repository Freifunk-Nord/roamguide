ROAM-Guide
----------

Helps your clients to search for a better AP and to have an nice roaming experience.

The roaming guide runs as a cronjob every minute on your ap and verifies that clients
have an acceptable TQ towards the AP. If that isn't the case it will deauth the client
by stating that the AP is full, enabling the client to look for an alternative AP.

This is happening in three definable stages depending on the TQ of the client.
When a client has decided to come back after the ban-time it will not be bothered
again unless it emerge to the next TQ level or it has been kicked $stage times.
For every stage the client is guide the ban time will be increased. So by default
the first stage has a bantime of 500ms, the second 2775ms and the third 10000ms.

When a client is away for some definable time or is below the first stages TQ,
we will forget about him, and re-enable the guiding.

Configuration
-------------

In '/etc/config/roamguide' the following default configuration is available,
to activate you need to set enabled to '1'.

    config roamguide
       option device "client0"        # wireless AP device we like to guide
       list signal '-60'              # first penality level, in dBm
       list signal '-77'              # second penality level, in dBm
       list signal '-85'              # final penality level. in dBm
       option bantime_base '500'      # on the first level ban for 500ms
       option bantime_factor '2375'   # on the second one for 2775ms,
                                      # and in the final 10000ms
       option forget_time '600'       # Forget about a client after 10s
       option enabled '0'             # set to '1' to enable this profile

You also need to create a cronjob calling /usr/bin/roamguide once a minute.
So for example by placing the following line in /etc/crontabs/root:

    * * * * * /usr/bin/roamguide
